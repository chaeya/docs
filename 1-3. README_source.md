## Build Method
: Execute the export JAR task in the build.gradle file of this SDK project to generate a JAR file.
1. Open the project's `build.gradle` file and add the following `export JAR` task.
```groovy
ext {
    version = "1.0.0"
}

task exportJar(type: Copy){
    from('build/intermediates/aar_main_jar/release/')
    into('release/')
    include('classes.jar')
    rename('classes.jar', 'opendid-core-sdk-aos-${version}.jar')
}
```
2. Open the `Gradle` window in Android Studio, and run the `Tasks > other > exportJar` task of the project.
3. Once the execution is complete, the `opendid-core-sdk-aos-1.0.0.jar` file will be generated in the `release/` folder.

<br>

## SDK Application Method
1. Copy the `opendid-core-sdk-aos-1.0.0.jar` file to the libs of the app project.
2. Add the following dependencies to the build.gradle of the app project.

```groovy
    implementation files('libs/opendid-core-sdk-aos-1.0.0.jar')
    implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.10.1'
    implementation 'androidx.biometric:biometric:1.1.0'

    implementation 'com.madgag.spongycastle:core:1.54.0.0'
    implementation 'com.madgag.spongycastle:prov:1.54.0.0'
    implementation 'com.madgag.spongycastle:pkix:1.54.0.0'
    implementation 'com.madgag.spongycastle:pg:1.54.0.0'
```
3. Sync `Gradle` to ensure the dependencies are properly added.
